# Escalation via Stored Passwords
Manual Enumeration:
- check `history`
	- can also cat out the bash history
		- `cat .bash_history`
	- `history | grep pass`
- `su root` - can try weak common passwords
- don't forget ls -- lookout for whats in front of us 
- Files containing passwords
```bash
grep --color=auto -rnw '/' -ie "PASSWORD" --color=always 2> /dev/null
find . -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD" {} /dev/null \;
```
- recommend scripting
	- can use linpeas as well to spot passwords

# Escalation via Weak File Permissions
Look for: do we have access to file(s) that we shouldn't, can we execute, modify, etc.
etc/shadow , etc/passwd example
- check `ls -la` to show directory permissions
- `cat` if possible
- this will be identified with automated tools as well
- copy contents of directory >> save >> use unshadow tool
```bash
unshadow
unshadow PASSWOD-FILE SHADOW-FILE #use file names
```
- after unshadow >> copy and paste into txt >> delete whatever doesn't have hash >> save and can crack hash with hashcat

# Escalation via SSH Keys
Can search sensitive files:
```bash
find / -name authorized_keys 2> /dev/null
find / -name id_rsa 2> /dev/null
```
id_rsa = private key
public keys in the authorized_keys folder
