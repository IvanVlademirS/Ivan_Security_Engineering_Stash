*after exploiting machine and obtaining low-level shell >> logged in as user TCM, not root user so need to elevate privileges*

# System Enumeration
❗️ QUICK WINS:
- what is our machine name
- what are we running
```bash
hostname
uname -a #get kernel info and can search for exploits
cat /proc/version #similar
lscpu #get info about CPU
ps aux #what services are running
ps aux | grep root #what processes are root running
ps aux | grep <user> #what processes are specific user running
```

# User Enumeration
we figure who we are >> what permissions we have >> what we are capable of doing
❗️ QUICK WINS:
- who I am
- what architecture of system is
- what sudo privileges do i have
- what history is available to me
```bash
whoam
id #identify group ID
sudo -l #what can we run as sudo without pass
#try to access sensitive files
cat /etc/passwd #look at users, root at top, users typically at bottom
cat /etc/shadow #contains password hashes
cat /etc/group #group accesses
history #anything juicy
```

# Network Enumeration
❗️ QUICK WINS:
- what ports are open
- who are we communicating with
- who is out there
- what is our network in
- what networks do we have access to
```bash
ifconfig #old
ip #new
ip neigh #this is new arp-a, MAC addresses
netstat -ano #what ports are open, what comms exist
```

# Password Hunting
```bash
#manual ways to look

grep --color=auto -rnw '/' -ie "PASSWORD=" ==color=always 2> /dev/null #looks for passwords and highlights them RED, this is A LOT Of info though >> this is manual, can automate with tools

locate password | more #locale files with password in the name
locate pass | more #locale files with pass in the name

#search for keys
find / -name authorized_keys 2> /dev/null #find files with authorized_keys
find / -name id_rsa 2> /dev/null #find file with id_rsa
```
