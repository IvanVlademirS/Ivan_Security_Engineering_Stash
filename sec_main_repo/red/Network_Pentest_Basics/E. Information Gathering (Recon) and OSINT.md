# Passive Reconnaissance Overview
### Physical/Social sites:
- Location Information
	- satellite images
	- drone recon
	- building layout (badge readers, break areas, security guards, fencing)
- Job Information
	- employees (name, job title, phone number, manager, etc.)
	- pictures (badge photos, desk photos, computer photos, etc.)

### Web/Host:
- Target validation
	- WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecon
- Finding subdomains
	- Google fu, dig, nmap, sublist3r, bluto, crt.sh, etc.
- Fingerprinting
	- nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat
- Data breaches (incidents from the past that have leaked data)

# Discovering Email Addresses 
### Tools
- **hunter.io** >> best GUI, but only a certain amount free per month, limited export
- **phonebook.cz** >> free domain search + export
- **Clearbit Connect** (chrome extension) >> use with gmail, use hacking email, searches emails and associated socials, can search by role and seniority
- **tools.verifyemailaddress.io** >> use to verify if emails exist
- email-checker.net/validate >> verify emails

### Process 
1. Start with google searches
2. phonebook.cz company domains
3. Clearbit (has limited searches with free version)
4. verify emails

# Gathering Breached Creds with Breach-Parse
### Process for breached creds:
- search company >> verify hashes/pass
- can use for credential stuffing and password spraying
- cred stuffing: take known usernames and use known/discovered passwords at it from list
- pass spraying: take known usernames and use any passwords against them

## breach-parse
A tool for parsing breached passwords
- LOCAL tool, the DB may not be maintained

### [](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse#installation)Installation
Install: `sudo ./install.sh`

Download breached password list from magnet located here: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:7ffbcd8cee06aba2ce6561688cf68ce2addca0a3&dn=BreachCompilation&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fglotorrents.pw%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337`

If you don't store the password list (BreachCompilation) in `/opt/breach-parse`, specify the location like:

`breach-parse @gmail.com gmail.txt "~/Downloads/BreachCompilation/data"`

Run `breach-parse` for instructions

# Hunting Breached Creds with DeHashed
- dehashed.com >> not free
- excellent GUI search engine >> shows hashes and passwords
- can verify hashes on google and hashes.org

# Hunting Subdomains
- sublist3r  >> `apt install sublist3r`
	- enumerates subdomains
- crt.sh >> user cert fingerprinting on domains, use % as wildcard
- OWASP Amass >> best tool for subdomain hunting
	- https://github.com/OWASP/Amass
- tomnomnom httpprobe - can use after obtaining list to verify

# Identifying Website Technologies
- what is a website built with
- builtwith.com >> looks for different technologies a company is using
	- focus on finding techstacks and frameworks
	- gives most info
- wappalyzer (use for firefox) >> similar to builtwith but more simple (plugin)
- whatweb - CLI tool built-in kali, `whatweb (insert domain)`
	- can give version numbers
- can list tech identified to check for exploits

# Info Gathering with Burp Suite
- web Proxy >> community edition is free
- need to config firefox to start using
	- set up proxy: https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/external-browser-config/browser-config-firefox
	- set up certs: https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/external-browser-config/certificate/ca-cert-firefox#:~:text=From%20the%20navigation%20bar%20on,downloaded%20earlier%20and%20click%20Open.
- can gather a ton of info on targets through interception of requests

# Google Fu
- operators: https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/
for example: tesla.com
- specify domain: `site:tesla.com`
	- take out the www: `site:tesla.com -www`
- filetype: `site:tesla.com filetype:csv`
