# 5 Stages

1. **Reconnaissance / Info Gathering**
	- active vs passive
	- The white-hat hacker collects all the information available about the networks and systems in place, as well as the security measures that have been implemented.
2. **Scanning & Enumeration**
	- nmap, nessus, nikto, etc
	- This step involves using all the information obtained in the reconnaissance phase and applying it to look for vulnerabilities in the targeted area. There are different types of scans done by ethical hackers. They can scan for open ports or different services that are running unprotected in the organization. 
	- Ethical hackers can also perform vulnerability scans to find weaknesses in the company servers, which can be exploited. This process has become automated because there are many [tools](https://www.invensislearning.com/blog/top-ethical-hacking-tools/) available for hackers to perform vulnerability scans. White hat hackers can also create various ‘maps’ of networks. This process of network mapping includes finding the firewall used by the organization and different routers and networks to help them during their hacking process.
3. **Gaining Access (Exploitation)**
	- This is where the ethical hacker does the actual hacking. He uses all the information obtained and analyzed from the previous two phases to launch a full-fledged attack on the system or network the ethical hacker is trying to infiltrate. He exploits all the exposed vulnerabilities and gains control of the system he has hacked. Now the hacker can steal all the data he has available on hand, corrupt the systems, add viruses or other malicious entities, or manipulate it to his/her benefit.
4. **Maintaining Access**
	- Usually, hackers have a mission to accomplish or a plan to follow when they hack into an organization’s system. This means just breaking into or hacking into the system is not going to be enough. The ethical hacker has to maintain his access to the server until he fulfills his goal. Ethical hackers usually employ Trojans and other backdoors or rootkits to accomplish this phase. They can also use this maintaining access phase to launch several other attacks to inflict more damage to the organization.
5. **Covering Tracks (clean up)**
	- This is the final step to complete the entire ethical hacking process. If this phase is completed successfully, the ethical hacker has managed to hack into a system or network. He/she could inflict as much damage as possible and has managed to leave the system without a trace. They need to cover their tracks throughout to avoid detection while entering and leaving the network or server. The security systems in place should not be able to identify the attacker. The sign of a successful simulated cyber attack is if the security system never realized that an attack took place altogether.
	- This includes many of the following measures that an ethical hacker takes to hide and remove his presence completely:
		-   Deleting all logs
		-   Corrupting logs
		-   Modifying certain values of logs or registries
		-   Deleting all the folders that have been created by the ethical hacker
		-   Uninstalling all the applications
		-   Removing all traces of any activity performed by an ethical hacker in the system or network
